# 1. Object-Oriented Python

## OOP Refresher
- Python does not require you to yse objects or classes
- As programs get more complex, it becomes harder to keep organized and make sure new code doesn't affect old code
- OOP helps with this issue and allows it to be more easily maintained and makes it easier for new readers to understand as well as yourself if you come back  to it months/ years later
    - Groups together data and behaviour into one place
    - Helps reduce bugs
    - Promotes modularization
    - Parts of program don't need to know how other parts work
        - if part of program needs to be updated or replaced, it can be done with minimal to no changes to other parts
  
- **Class** : A blueprint  for creating objects of a particular type
- **Methods** : Regular functions that are part of a class
- **Attributes** : Variables that hold data that are part of a class
- **Object** : A specific instance of a class
- **Inheritance** : Means by which a class can inherit capabilities from another
- **Composition** : Means of building complex objects out of other objects

# 1. Object-Oriented Python

## OOP Refresher
- Python does not require you to yse objects or classes
- As programs get more complex, it becomes harder to keep organized and make sure new code doesn't affect old code
- OOP helps with this issue and allows it to be more easily maintained and makes it easier for new readers to understand as well as yourself if you come back  to it months/ years later
